# Practice - programs written in C / C++.

This repository contains programs which I have written to learn **C / C ++**.

1. ```Trinagle``` - checks that the entered numbers can construct a triangle.
2. `Correlation` - checks correlation between two numbers (bigger, smaller, equal).
3. `Divisibility` - checks the divisibility of the number A by the number B.
4. `Calculations` - calculations for a function with the given formula.
5. `Interval` - checks how many numbers belonging to the interval.
6. `Function` - first function.
7. `Circle` - presents field and circuit for the entered radius.
8. `Analytic geometry` - checks that the entered point is included in the circle.
9. `Logarithm` - calculates the value of the logarithm from the number two.
10. `The exponential function` - shows the value of the exponential function.
11. `Calculation` - presents the result of the square root.
12. `Sum` - sum of the even elements from the entered table.
13. `Third part` - checks that the entered points are included in third part of the 
coordinate system.
14. `Binomial theorem` - the program for calculating the value of newton binomial.
15. `Tables` - creates second table including only positive numbers from the first entered table.
16. `Pointers` - performs calculations based on points in the coordinate system.
The program uses pointers to send data to functions.
